**Step-by-Step Installation Plan:**

Assuming you've installed the base system, here's a high-level plan for installing the remaining components:

1. Install the LLM agent orchestration tool (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenAI Codex) as soon as possible after the base system installation.
2. Use the LLM agent to automate the installation of the following components:
	* Package manager (e.g., pacman, nix, or xbps)
	* Window manager/desktop environment (e.g., Sway, i3, or Xfce)
	* Systemd init system
	* Graphics drivers (e.g., NVIDIA and AMD)
	* Development tools (e.g., Python, Java, Rust, and JavaScript)
	* AI/ML tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn)
	* Music production software (e.g., MIDI tools and guitar input software)
3. Configure the system to use the desired package manager, window manager/desktop environment, and init system.
4. Install and configure Steam, Proton, WINE, and other gaming-related software.
5. Install and configure software development tools, AI/ML tools, and music production software as needed.
6. Use the LLM agent to automate system maintenance tasks, such as updates and package management.

Please note that this plan is high-level and may require additional steps depending on your specific requirements. It's essential to consult the documentation for each component and the LLM agent orchestration tool to ensure a smooth installation process.
