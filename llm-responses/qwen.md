# System76 Kudu Custom LLM-Friendly Developer Gaming Laptop Build

## üß† Top 5 Suitable Linux Distributions

All five options are rolling-release or near-rolling, support systemd, and offer strong automation and scripting capabilities.

---

### 1. **NixOS**

**Why It Fits:**
- **Declarative, immutable configuration** via `configuration.nix` is ideal for LLM parsing and automation.
- Rolling updates available (unstable channel).
- Excellent reproducibility and atomic upgrades/rollbacks.
- Supports Wayland, X11, and hybrid GPU setups.
- Native support for package overlays, custom kernels, and overlays for Steam/Proton/WINE.
- Strong support for developer environments via `nix-shell` and `devShells`.

**Considerations:**
- Steeper learning curve due to functional configuration model.
- Requires familiarity with the Nix expression language.
- Binary cache usage avoids long compile times.

---

### 2. **Arch Linux (with AUR helpers like `paru` or `yay`)**

**Why It Fits:**
- Pure rolling release.
- Excellent AUR support for bleeding-edge and custom software (e.g., Glorious Eggroll Proton, custom WINE builds).
- Easy automation using `pacman`, shell scripts, and declarative tools like `aconfmgr`.
- Clear and simple filesystem layout.
- Strong community and documentation.

**Considerations:**
- Requires manual setup of hybrid GPU drivers (e.g., PRIME offloading).
- Rolling release can be unstable if not maintained carefully.

---

### 3. **openSUSE Tumbleweed**

**Why It Fits:**
- True rolling release with QA-tested packages.
- Uses `zypper` and `rpm`, with strong transactional-update support.
- YaST for automation and administration.
- Good support for hybrid graphics via `switcheroo-control` and `suse-prime`.
- Strong for development and cloud environments.

**Considerations:**
- Slightly heavier than Arch/NixOS.
- Less bleeding edge than Arch but more stable than raw Arch.

---

### 4. **Gentoo (Hybrid Binary/Source Configuration)**

**Why It Fits:**
- Ultimate control over system builds ‚Äî critical for AI/ML workloads and custom compiler flags.
- Portage supports binary packages (`FEATURES="buildpkg"`, `emerge --usepkg`).
- Can selectively build only performance-critical packages (e.g., CUDA, Python, Rust).
- Supports systemd.
- Wayland and hybrid GPU setups well-documented.

**Considerations:**
- Time-consuming if not using binary packages strategically.
- May require careful curation of `package.use`, `make.conf`, and `package.accept_keywords`.

---

### 5. **Fedora Workstation/Rawhide (with Copr and custom repos)**

**Why It Fits:**
- Close to rolling with biannual major releases and frequent updates.
- Strong support for Wayland, hybrid graphics, and modern toolchains.
- Excellent for gaming (Steam, Proton, etc.) via RPM Fusion.
- Strong DevOps and cloud-native tooling.
- Rawhide offers bleeding-edge support.

**Considerations:**
- Not truly rolling‚Äîpoint releases may break workflows.
- Requires frequent upgrades and careful repo management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Installation Plan

Assuming you're open to any of the above distributions, here's a step-by-step installation plan that can be automated by an LLM agent like Claude Code:

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Installation Plan

---

### **Phase 1: Base System Installation**

1. **Boot from ISO**:
   - Use distribution-specific live media (e.g., ArchISO, NixOS ISO, openSUSE TW).

2. **Partitioning**:
   ```bash
   # Example for systemd-boot on UEFI
   /dev/nvme0n1p1 1GiB EFI System (vfat) ‚Üí /efi
   /dev/nvme0n1p2 16GiB swap
   /dev/nvme0n1p3 rest as XFS ‚Üí /
   ```

3. **Install Base System**:
   - Use distro-specific installer or manual debootstrap (`debootstrap`, `pacstrap`, etc.).
   - Enable `systemd` as init.

4. **Install Bootloader (`systemd-boot`)**:
   ```bash
   bootctl install
   ```

5. **Configure Network**:
   - Use `systemd-networkd` or NetworkManager.
   - Enable WiFi with `iwd` or `wpa_supplicant`.

---

### **Phase 2: GPU Setup**

6. **Install Hybrid Graphics Support**:
   - For NVIDIA + AMD:
     - Install `nvidia`, `mesa`, `xf86-video-amdgpu`.
     - Enable PRIME offloading via `xrandr --setprovideroffloadsink`.

   - For Wayland:
     - Use compositor-specific GPU config (e.g., `WLR_DRM_DEVICES`).

7. **Install Proprietary NVIDIA Driver**:
   ```bash
   nvidia-drivers  # e.g., via portage, pacman, or zypper
   ```

---

### **Phase 3: Core Tools and Automation**

8. **Install Core Tools**:
   - `git`, `curl`, `python3`, `rust`, `go`, `nodejs`, `lua`, `perl`, `haskell`, `sbcl`, etc.
   - Install `docker`, `podman`, `kubectl`, `gcloud`, `aws-cli`, `terraform`, etc.

9. **Install LLM Agent Orchestration Tool**:
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pip install claude-code  # or equivalent
     ```

10. **Setup Dotfiles and Automation Scripts**:
    - Use declarative configs (e.g., `home-manager` in NixOS, `dotbot`, or shell scripts).
    - Include config for terminal, shell, editor, and automation tools.

---

### **Phase 4: Gaming and Multimedia**

11. **Install Gaming Stack**:
    - Steam, Proton (GE), WINE (custom builds), Lutris.
    - Vulkan + DXVK + MangoHud.
    - Enable GameMode.

12. **Install MIDI/audio tools**:
    - `jack2`, `ardour`, `lmms`, `qsynth`, `carla`.
    - Configure real-time kernel settings.

---

### **Phase 5: AI/ML Stack**

13. **Install Python ML Stack**:
    - `pytorch`, `tensorflow`, `transformers`, `jupyter`, `langchain`, etc.
    - Use `conda` or `pip` in virtual environments.

14. **Install CUDA/cuDNN**:
    - Match with installed NVIDIA driver.
    - Ensure compatibility with PyTorch/TensorFlow.

15. **Install LLM Tooling**:
    - `ollama`, `llama.cpp`, `vLLM`, `text-generation-webui`, etc.

---

### **Phase 6: Final Automation Layer**

16. **Install Declarative Config Manager**:
    - NixOS: `configuration.nix`
    - Arch: `aconfmgr` or simple git-managed scripts.
    - Gentoo: `etc-update` + `dispatch-conf`

17. **Install System Monitoring**:
    - `htop`, `btop`, `nvidia-smi`, `nvtop`, `iotop`, etc.

18. **Schedule Backup and Snapshot Jobs**:
    - Use `btrfs`, `timeshift`, `snapper`, or `restic`.

---

## üîö Final Notes

- **Recommendation**: **NixOS** is the most LLM-agent-friendly due to its declarative nature. If you want bleeding edge + binary fast installs, combine with `nixpkgs-unstable`.
- **Runner-up**: **Arch Linux** with heavy use of AUR and `paru/yay` for custom builds.
- **Hybrid Gentoo** is viable but will require careful scripting to avoid compile timeouts.
