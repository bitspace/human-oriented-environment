## Introduction

Customizing a high-end laptop like the Lenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen2 Intel for diverse and demanding workloads—ranging from software development and AI/ML research to gaming and music production—requires a carefully chosen Linux distribution and graphical environment. The user’s extensive Linux experience and preference for rolling release distributions with systemd init, combined with the need for a Wayland-based graphical interface that is scriptable and parseable by a Large Language Model (LLM), narrows the field considerably. Additionally, the early integration of an LLM agent orchestration tool imposes further constraints on the installation process and system configuration.

This report synthesizes comprehensive research to identify the top 5 Linux distributions and top 5 window managers/desktop environments that best fit these constraints. It also provides a detailed step-by-step installation plan incorporating the LLM agent and outlines the necessary configurations for the user’s diverse workloads.
