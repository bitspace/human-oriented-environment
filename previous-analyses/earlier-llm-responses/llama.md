Based on the constraints and requirements, I recommend the top 5 most suitable Linux distributions:

1. **Arch Linux**: Arch's rolling release model and pacman/AUR ecosystem align with your preferences. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an excellent choice for a customized system.
2. **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**: Tumbleweed is a rolling release distribution that uses the zypper package manager. It's a great option if you're looking for a distribution with a strong focus on stability and a large package repository.
3. **NixOS**: As you mentioned, NixOS is a declarative-style distribution that uses the Nix package manager. Its unique approach to package management and configuration makes it an attractive choice for a customized system.
4. **Gentoo (with a hybrid binary/source configuration)**: Although you mentioned that a fully source-based option might not be feasible, a hybrid configuration could work well. Gentoo's portage package/dependency system is powerful, and with a mix of binary and source packages, you can achieve a good balance between compilation time and customization.
5. **Fedora Rawhide**: Fedora Rawhide is a rolling release distribution that uses the dnf package manager. It's a great option if you're looking for a distribution with a strong focus on bleeding-edge software and a large community.

For window managers or desktop environments, I recommend the following 5 options that suit the stated constraints and requirements:

1. **i3**: A lightweight, highly customizable window manager that's easy to script and automate.
2. **sway**: A Wayland compositor that's designed to be highly customizable and scriptable.
3. **XFCE**: A lightweight desktop environment that's easy to customize and has a small footprint.
4. **LXQt**: A lightweight desktop environment that's highly customizable and has a small footprint.
5. **bspwm**: A tiling window manager that's highly customizable and scriptable.

Here's a step-by-step plan to perform the installation:

**Step 1: Install the base system**

* Choose one of the recommended distributions and download the installation media.
* Boot from the installation media and follow the installation process to install the base system.

**Step 2: Install the LLM agent orchestration tool**

* As soon as the base system is installed, install the LLM agent orchestration tool (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenAI Codex).
* Configure the tool to manage the system and automate tasks.

**Step 3: Configure the package manager and repositories**

* Configure the package manager (e.g., pacman, zypper, or dnf) to use the recommended repositories.
* Add any additional repositories required for specific software (e.g., Steam, Proton, or WINE).

**Step 4: Install required software**

* Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to install the required software, including:
	+ Programming languages and frameworks (e.g., Python, Java, Rust, JavaScript, C, C++, Lua, Perl, and Haskell).
	+ Development tools (e.g., Git, GCC, and LLVM).
	+ Cloud development tools (e.g., AWS CLI, GCP CLI, and Azure CLI).
	+ Gaming software (e.g., Steam, Proton, and WINE).
	+ Music production software (e.g., MIDI tools and audio editors).

**Step 5: Configure the window manager or desktop environment**

* Choose one of the recommended window managers or desktop environments and install it.
* Configure the window manager or desktop environment to suit your needs, using the LLM agent orchestration tool to automate tasks.

**Step 6: Finalize the system configuration**

* Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to finalize the system configuration, including:
	+ Network configuration.
	+ Security settings.
	+ Systemd configuration.
	+ Any other system settings required for your specific use case.

By following these steps, you'll have a customized Linux system that meets your requirements and is optimized for your specific use case.
