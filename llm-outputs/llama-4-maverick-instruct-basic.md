## Distribution Selection

Based on your requirements, I have evaluated various Linux distributions. Given your constraints, here are the top 5 most suitable distributions:

1. **Arch Linux**: A rolling release distribution with a simple and efficient package manager (pacman). It has a large community and is well-documented. The Arch User Repository (AUR) provides access to a vast number of packages.
2. **OpenSUSE Tumbleweed**: A rolling release distribution that uses the RPM package manager and the dnf package manager's predecessor, zypper. It is known for its stability and has a large user base.
3. **Manjaro**: Based on Arch Linux, Manjaro offers a more user-friendly installation process while maintaining the benefits of Arch's rolling release model and pacman package manager.
4. **Void Linux**: A rolling release distribution that uses the XBPS package manager. It is known for its simplicity and speed. Void Linux is not based on any other distribution and has a growing community.
5. **Solus**: A rolling release distribution that uses the eopkg package manager. It is known for its curated package selection and user-friendly interface.

## Window Manager/Desktop Environment Selection

For a Qt-based GUI application preference and avoiding Gnome and KDE, here are 5 suitable window managers or desktop environments:

1. **i3**: A tiling window manager that is highly configurable and uses a simple text-based configuration file.
2. **sway**: A Wayland compositor that is compatible with i3 configuration files, making it an excellent choice for those familiar with i3.
3. **LXQt**: A lightweight Qt-based desktop environment that is highly customizable and has a simple configuration file structure.
4. **Qtile**: A Python-based tiling window manager that is highly configurable and extensible.
5. **Hyprland**: A Wayland compositor that is highly customizable and has a growing community.

## Installation Plan

Here's a step-by-step plan to perform the installation:

### Step 1: Install the Base System

1. Choose one of the recommended distributions (Arch Linux, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, Manjaro, Void Linux, or Solus) and follow their installation guide to install the base system.
2. Ensure that the system is installed with systemd as the init system.

### Step 2: Install LLM Agent Orchestration Tool

1. As soon as possible during the installation process, install an LLM agent orchestration tool such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenAI Codex.
2. Configure the tool to interact with the system using natural language.

### Step 3: Configure the System

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to configure the system, including:
	* Setting up networking and package managers.
	* Installing necessary packages for polyglot software development (Python, Java, JavaScript, Rust, etc.).
	* Configuring the window manager or desktop environment.

### Step 4: Install Development Tools

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to install development tools, including:
	* Visual Studio Code (Insiders).
	* JetBrains products.
	* Other necessary development tools.

### Step 5: Configure AI Development Environment

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to configure the AI development environment, including:
	* Installing necessary packages for AI development (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
	* Configuring tools for MLOps and AI Engineering.

### Step 6: Install Cloud Development Tools

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to install cloud development tools, including:
	* AWS and GCP SDKs.
	* Other necessary cloud development tools.

### Step 7: Configure Gaming Environment

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to configure the gaming environment, including:
	* Installing Steam, WINE, Lutris, and Proton/Vulkan.
	* Configuring tuned or customized builds of Proton (e.g., GloriousEggroll's Proton).

### Step 8: Configure Audio Engineering Environment

1. Use the LLM agent orchestration tool to configure the audio engineering environment, including:
	* Installing necessary packages for audio engineering and music production.
	* Configuring MIDI and input from keyboards and guitars.

By following this plan, you should be able to create a customized Linux system that meets your requirements and is optimized for ease of automation, scripting, and interaction with LLM agents.
