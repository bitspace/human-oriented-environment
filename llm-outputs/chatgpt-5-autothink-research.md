# Minimal Rolling Linux for AI Agent Orchestration

## Top 5 Linux Distributions for a Minimal AI-Focused Base

For a **Lenovo ThinkPad P16 Gen2 (i9-13980HX, 192GB RAM, Intel UHD
graphics, 4TB SSD)**, the following five Linux distros provide a
minimal, **rolling-release** base with **systemd** init and scriptable
package management. Each is well-suited for quickly bootstrapping an
environment where AI agents can automate system configuration:

-   **Arch Linux:** A lightweight, rolling-release distro that starts
    **barebones (no bloat)** and lets you add only what you
    need[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/yhg3t8/why_arch/#:~:text=,reservation%20and%20I%20love%20it)[\[2\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/archlinuxen/posts/10161399867098393/#:~:text=Hi%21%20Does%20it%20make%20sense,a%20system%20as%20you).
    Arch uses `pacman`, a simple package manager known for its **easy
    scripting and text-based
    output**[\[3\]](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman#:~:text=The%20pacman%20package%20manager%20is,or%20the%20user%27s%20own%20builds).
    It has immediate access to the latest packages and an enormous
    community-maintained repository (AUR) for virtually any
    software[\[4\]](https://itsfoss.com/best-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=BTW%2C%20Arch%20Linux%20is%20the,a%20synonym%20with%20rolling%20release).
    *Arch is ideal if you want full control and don't mind manual
    setup.* (Systemd is the default init.)

-   **openSUSE Tumbleweed:** A **stable rolling-release** on the RPM
    side. Tumbleweed's packages undergo **rigorous automated testing
    (openQA)** for
    stability[\[5\]](https://linuxblog.io/linux-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=,rolling%20release%20without%20frequent%20breakages),
    making it one of the most reliable rolling distros. It uses `zypper`
    for package management and offers powerful tools like YaST, all of
    which can be driven via command line (suitable for
    scripting)[\[6\]](https://itsfoss.com/best-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=openSUSE%20Tumbleweed%20makes%20a%20great,of%20options%20for%20package%20management).
    *Great for cutting-edge software with fewer breakages.* (Uses
    systemd by default.)

-   **Manjaro Linux:** An Arch-based rolling distro that **buffers Arch
    updates** for extra testing, providing a *"stable Arch"*
    experience[\[7\]](https://itsfoss.com/best-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=Manjaro%20is%20basically%20Arch%2C%20minus,that%20comes%20with%20Arch%20Linux).
    You get **pacman and AUR** support with an easier installer and
    out-of-the-box hardware
    support[\[8\]](https://itsfoss.com/best-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=It%20is%20based%20on%20Arch,You).
    Manjaro's package outputs are the same as Arch's, script-friendly
    and parseable. *Ideal if you want Arch's benefits with a safety net
    and quicker install.* (Uses systemd.)

-   **Debian Testing/Unstable:** Debian *Testing* (and Sid/Unstable) can
    function as a rolling release, delivering newer packages within
    weeks of Debian unstable, but with some added
    stability[\[9\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/11inoxv/anyone_have_debian_testing_rolling_release_as/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,weeks%20to%20migrate%20from)[\[10\]](https://linuxblog.io/linux-rolling-release-distros/#:~:text=,slightly%20more%20stable%20than%20pure).
    It uses the well-known `apt`/`dpkg` system, which is robust for
    scripting (e.g. `apt-get -qq` for quiet output). *This gives you a
    more up-to-date Debian base without the long freezes of stable.*
    (Default init is systemd on Debian.)

-   **Fedora (Workstation or Silverblue):** Fedora isn't strictly
    rolling, but its **fast 6-month release cycle** keeps you *very
    up-to-date* with latest kernels, compilers, and
    libraries[\[11\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/fedora-operating-system/#:~:text=Fedora%20Linux%20is%20a%20free,the%20latest%20software%20and%20technologies)[\[12\]](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/fedora-operating-system/#:~:text=and%20powerful%20operating%20system.%20,Fedora%20supports%20a%20large%20community).
    DNF (`dnf`) is a modern CLI package manager (Yum successor) with
    easily parseable output and plugins for scripting. A minimal Fedora
    netinstall can provide a bare system with only the basics. *Fedora
    offers a good balance of new software and stability if a true
    rolling release isn't a must.* (Uses systemd.)

Each of these distros supports the ThinkPad's hardware well (Intel GPU
has open-source driver support out-of-the-box). All use **systemd**
(meeting your init preference) and have **text-based package managers**
that an LLM agent can parse and operate. They also allow a **minimal
networked base install** so you can immediately hand off further setup
to AI.

## 5 Scriptable Wayland Desktop Environments / Window Managers (non-GNOME/KDE)

*Example of the lightweight* *LXQt* *desktop running on the Hyprland
Wayland compositor (showing a Qt panel, menu, and a config file open in
a text editor). This setup is highly customizable via simple text
configs and scripts.*

When choosing a GUI for automation, we want environments that are
**easily configured with scripts or plain-text files**, have
**LLM-friendly config formats**, and preferably use **Qt (avoiding heavy
GTK dependence)**. All the options below work on **Wayland** (for
future-proof display support) and handle multi-monitor setups:

-   **LXQt (with Wayland compositor):** LXQt is a **lightweight Qt
    desktop environment** with a modular design. It can now run on a
    Wayland session by pairing it with a compatible compositor (instead
    of its default X11 window manager). In practice, you can use LXQt
    alongside wlroots-based Wayland WMs like **Labwc** or even KWin
    (Wayland)[\[13\]](https://lxqt-project.org/blog/2024/04/15/wayland_faq/#:~:text=Which%20compositor%20is%20used%3F).
    Notably, LXQt **recommends Labwc** (a minimal Openbox-like Wayland
    compositor) for its stability and familiar openbox-style
    settings[\[14\]](https://lxqt-project.org/blog/2024/04/15/wayland_faq/#:~:text=Is%20there%20a%20recommended%20one%3F).
    LXQt provides a taskbar, application menu, system tray, etc., all
    implemented in Qt -- these are visually configurable via GUI tools,
    and under the hood LXQt stores settings in simple config files (e.g.
    `.conf` files easily editable by scripts/LLMs). *This gives you a
    traditional desktop feel while remaining lightweight and
    scriptable.* (Labwc's config is similar to Openbox's XML, which an
    AI could parse; or KWin's KCM files if using KWin.)

-   **Sway:** Sway is a popular **tiling Wayland compositor** that is a
    drop-in replacement for the i3 window
    manager[\[15\]](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Sway#:~:text=Sway%20is%20a%20tiling%20Wayland,with%20your%20existing%20i3).
    Configuration is done in a single text file (usually
    `~/.config/sway/config`) using a straightforward syntax (essentially
    the same as i3's). It's extremely scriptable: you can live-reload
    configs and use IPC commands (`swaymsg`) to control windows from
    scripts. Sway is renowned for its **keyboard-driven tiling**,
    logical window arrangement, and efficient use of screen
    space[\[16\]](https://swaywm.org/#:~:text=Sway%20allows%20you%20to%20arrange,manipulated%20using%20only%20the%20keyboard).
    Multi-monitor is well-supported (it inherits i3's multi-display
    workspace concepts). *For an AI agent, Sway's config and IPC are
    easy to parse and modify, and an LLM can safely interpret its
    plain-text status outputs.* (No Qt, but also minimal GTK -- mostly
    uses wlroots and i3-like text UIs.)

-   **Hyprland:** A **dynamic tiling Wayland compositor** with eye-candy
    and modern features. Hyprland supports **live configuration reload**
    and uses a simple plaintext config (INI-like syntax). It's known for
    smooth animations and a highly extensible plugin
    system[\[17\]](https://hypr.land/#:~:text=Hyprland%20provides%20the%20latest%20Wayland,still%20being%20lightweight%20and%20responsive)[\[18\]](https://hypr.land/#:~:text=Dynamic%20tiling).
    Crucially, Hyprland provides **socket-based IPC** and *bindings to
    control it via any programming language or
    shell*[\[19\]](https://hypr.land/#:~:text=Plugins,your%20own%20easily%20with%20C)
    -- perfect for automation. For example, an AI script could send
    Hyprland commands to open/position windows or adjust settings on the
    fly. It has "sensible defaults" and good
    documentation[\[20\]](https://hypr.land/#:~:text=Easy%20to%20configure),
    making it easier for an LLM to navigate. *This is a great choice if
    you want a flashy but scriptable Qt-free environment.* (Hyprland
    itself doesn't use Qt/GTK for core UI, though you'll likely use Qt
    apps on it given your preference.)

-   **River:** River is a **minimal dynamic tiling** compositor that
    draws inspiration from dwm. Uniquely, River has **no static config
    files** -- instead, all configuration is done *at runtime via
    commands*. You write a startup script (shell script) that calls
    `riverctl` to set keybindings, rules,
    etc.[\[21\]](https://isaacfreund.com/blog/river-intro/#:~:text=this%20behavior%20is%20strongly%20influenced,by%20dwm).
    This means your "config" is literally a series of commands (highly
    scriptable and naturally LLM-parsable). River's design prioritizes
    simplicity and predictability, with features like tag-based window
    management (Ã  la dwm). This approach is excellent for automation: an
    AI agent can modify the startup script or invoke `riverctl` commands
    directly to reconfigure the WM on the fly. *If you prefer writing
    shell scripts to configure your UI, River is ideal.* (It's also
    Wayland-native and very lightweight. Qt apps run fine on it, though
    River itself uses wlroots and no Qt.)

-   **Wayfire:** Wayfire is a **compiz-like Wayland compositor** that
    offers a classic **stacking window manager** experience with modern
    effects. It is **highly customizable and modular** (uses a plugin
    system for features), yet aims to remain
    lightweight[\[22\]](https://wayfire.org/#:~:text=Wayfire%20is%20a%20wayland%20compositor,environment%20without%20sacrificing%20its%20appearance).
    Configuration is done via a straightforward INI-style file
    (`wayfire.ini`) for enabling/disabling plugins, keybindings, etc.,
    which can be easily edited by scripts or an LLM. In fact, Wayfire
    now even includes an **IPC socket for external control** (as of
    v0.9)[\[23\]](https://wayfire.org/#:~:text=Hello%20everyone%21%20I%20am%20happy,powerful%20features%3A%20the%20IPC%20socket),
    which could allow advanced scripting of the environment. It supports
    things like virtual desktops, window switching and wobbly windows
    out-of-the-box[\[24\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/j5uj6a/wayfire_super_cool/#:~:text=,shell%20and%20some%20tiling%20functionalities),
    and there's a GUI config tool (Wayfire Config Manager) if
    needed[\[25\]](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wcm#:~:text=WayfireWM%2Fwcm%3A%20Wayfire%20Config%20Manager%20,reads%20to%20update%20option%20values).
    *Wayfire is a good fit if you want a traditional desktop (with
    overlapping windows and animations) that's still scriptable and not
    tied to GTK or KDE.* (It uses its own toolkit for the shell, and you
    can mix Qt apps freely.)

All the above options are **compatible with multi-monitor setups**. They
either have built-in multi-screen configuration modules or rely on
standard tools (e.g. Sway and Hyprland use `wlroots` which supports
mixed DPI monitors well, and LXQt can use KDE's KScreen or wlr-randr for
monitor setup on Wayland). By favoring Qt apps and neutral compositors,
you'll avoid heavy GNOME/GTK dependencies, keeping the system lean and
**AI-friendly for parsing configurations**.

## Step-by-Step Installation and Setup Plan

Finally, here's a **detailed plan to install a minimal base system** on
your ThinkPad and configure it to the point where AI orchestration tools
(Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, Gemini CLI) can take over:

**1. Prepare Installation Media & Boot:**

-   Download the ISO of your chosen distribution and create a bootable
    USB (e.g. using `dd` or Rufus). For instance, get the latest Arch
    Linux ISO for a pure rolling base, or the openSUSE Tumbleweed net
    installer, etc.
-   Boot the ThinkPad from this USB. In BIOS/UEFI settings, ensure
    **UEFI mode** is enabled (all these distros support UEFI; secure
    boot can be disabled for simplicity unless using a distro that
    supports it easily like Fedora).
-   At the boot menu, select the live environment. Once at a shell or
    installer prompt, **verify networking**:
    -   **Wired Ethernet:** Likely plug-and-play (DHCP should assign
        IP).
    -   **Wi-Fi:** If needed, connect using available tools:
    -   On Arch live ISO, use `iwctl` (iNet wireless daemon) -- e.g.,
        `iwctl station wlan0 connect SSID`.
    -   On Fedora/openSUSE live, use `nmtui` or `nmcli` to connect
        Wi-Fi.
    -   Confirm network with `ping archlinux.org` or similar. Internet
        access is required to fetch packages.

**2. Partition the 4TB SSD:**

-   Decide on a partitioning scheme. For simplicity: use **GPT
    partitioning** with UEFI:
    -   Create a small **EFI System Partition** (e.g. 300--500 MB,
        FAT32) for bootloader.
    -   Create a **root partition** covering the rest (or separate
        `/home`, etc., as needed). Given 4TB, you might opt for:
    -   A root (`/`) partition of adequate size (500 GB or more) and a
        large `/home` for data, *or* just one big root if simplicity is
        key.
    -   Optionally, a swap partition if you want (though with 192GB RAM,
        swap is less crucial; you could use a swapfile later if needed).
-   You can use `cfdisk` or `parted` for partitioning. For example, in
    `parted`:
    -   `parted /dev/nvme0n1 -- mklabel gpt`
    -   `parted /dev/nvme0n1 -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 501MiB` (set boot
        flag on this)
    -   `parted /dev/nvme0n1 -- mkpart primary ext4 501MiB 100%`.
-   Format the partitions:
    -   `mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1` for EFI.
    -   `mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p2` for Linux root (or use **btrfs** if
        you prefer snapshots/rollbacks -- btrfs is recommended for
        rolling releases to facilitate easy rollback in case an
        AI-initiated update misconfigures something).
-   Mount the filesystem for installation:
    -   e.g., `mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt` (this is your root FS).
    -   `mkdir /mnt/boot && mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot` (EFI
        mountpoint).

**3. Install the Minimal Base System:**

-   **Arch Linux example:** Use `pacstrap` to install the base system
    onto `/mnt`. Include:
    -   The **base** package group and Linux kernel:
        `pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware`.
    -   It's wise to add `networking utilities` now (so networking works
        on first boot). For instance:
        `pacstrap /mnt networkmanager dhcpcd dhclient` (NetworkManager
        and DHCP clients), and an **editor** like `nano` or `vim` for
        convenience.
    -   (Optionally, add `base-devel` if you anticipate building AUR
        packages early, though an AI agent can install it later too.)
-   **openSUSE Tumbleweed example:** Use the text mode installer or
    AutoYast:
    -   Select a **Minimal** or **JeOS** pattern. Ensure the installer
        includes at least `Network Manager` or `wicked` for networking,
        and a basic editor.
    -   Proceed with installation, which copies a minimal set of RPMs to
        the disk.
-   **Fedora example:** Use the netinstall ISO:
    -   Choose *Minimal Install* package set. Include "Development
        Tools" if desired, or skip to keep it bare.
    -   Ensure `NetworkManager` is selected.
-   **Debian Testing example:** Use the Debian net installer:
    -   When prompted for tasks, *uncheck desktop environments* and
        *uncheck extra tools*, leaving only "Standard system utilities".
        This gives a very minimal system.
    -   Install the **"SSH server"** if you want remote management
        ability out of the gate (optional).
-   The installer (or `pacstrap`) will copy the base system and then
    you'll chroot or configure.

**4. Configure the System (Chroot):**

-   For distros like Arch where you manually installed base:
    -   Chroot into the new system: `arch-chroot /mnt`.
    -   Set timezone (e.g.,
        `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime`).
    -   Generate locales: edit `/etc/locale.gen` to uncomment
        `en_US.UTF-8` and any others, then run `locale-gen`. Create
        `/etc/locale.conf` with `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`.
    -   Set hostname (echo e.g. `"thinkpad-p16"` \> /etc/hostname).
    -   Enable networking:
    -   For NetworkManager: `systemctl enable NetworkManager`.
    -   Alternatively, enable systemd-networkd with a basic DHCP config
        on your interface.
    -   If on Arch, set up **initramfs** (usually done by `mkinitcpio`
        automatically) and **microcode**: install `intel-ucode` package
        for Intel CPU firmware updates (ensures optimal performance and
        stability for the i9-13980HX).
    -   Set root password (`passwd`).
    -   Create an initial user (optional at this stage): e.g.
        `useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash yourname` and
        `passwd yourname`. (The AI agent could create users later, but
        having a non-root user with sudo can be safer for interactive
        use.)
    -   Install and configure a **bootloader**:
    -   For UEFI, a simple choice is **systemd-boot**: `bootctl install`
        (on Arch). Ensure an entry is created for your installed kernel
        with the initrd and intel-ucode. Or install **GRUB**:
        `pacman -S grub efibootmgr` then
        `grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB`
        and `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
    -   On Debian/Fedora, their installer would handle GRUB installation
        if you used the guided steps. On openSUSE, the YaST installer
        also handles bootloader automatically.
-   Exit chroot and reboot into the new system (remove the USB media).

**5. First Boot Verification:**

-   Boot the laptop into your new minimal Linux. You should land on a
    text console (login prompt).
-   Log in (as root or the user created).
-   Verify networking is working on the installed system:
    -   If you enabled NetworkManager, run `nmcli device status` to
        ensure your interface is connected (wired should connect
        automatically via DHCP; for Wi-Fi, use `nmtui` or `nmcli` to
        join your network if not done yet).
    -   If using systemd-networkd, check
        `systemctl status systemd-networkd` and try `ping 8.8.8.8` or
        so.
-   **Update package database and system:** Since it's rolling, do an
    update to get latest fixes:
    -   Arch: `pacman -Syu` (make sure mirrors are updated).
    -   Tumbleweed: `zypper ref && zypper dup` (dup = dist-upgrade,
        since Tumbleweed updates are snapshot-based).
    -   Fedora: `dnf update -y`.
    -   Debian Testing: `apt update && apt upgrade -y`.
-   Install **sudo** if not already: (Arch: `pacman -S sudo`;
    Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install sudo`). Add your user to sudoers (e.g.,
    use `visudo` to add `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` on Arch, or add user to
    `sudo` group on Debian).

**6. Essential Tools & Shell Utilities:**

Now bring in a few basic tools to facilitate further automated setup: -
**Command-line utilities:** Ensure tools like `curl` and `wget` are
installed (often part of base, but install if not). Also `git` (for code
checkout by AI, e.g., if the agent wants to pull dotfiles or scripts
from a repository). - **Text editor:** Install a simple editor for
manual fixes (`nano` or `vim` -- an AI could use `sed`/`echo` to edit
files, but having an editor is good for emergency). For example,
`pacman -S nano` or `apt install vim`. - **Shell of choice:** Bash is
default and fine. If you plan to use zsh or fish and want the AI to
configure those, you can defer installation until the AI phase. (The AI
can handle installing and configuring dotfiles for zsh, etc., upon your
instruction.) - **Development basics:** Since your use-case is polyglot
development, you might pre-install some language runtimes to save the AI
a step: - Python 3 (most distros include it or it can be installed with
one command: e.g., `pacman -S python python-pip` or
`apt install python3 pip`). - If on Arch, `base-devel` should have
installed compilers/make. If not, and for other distros, ensure
compilers are present (e.g., `sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"`
on Fedora or `apt install build-essential` on Debian) so AI scripts can
compile things if needed. - Git was mentioned (for pulling code). -
**Verify hardware functionality:** The minimal install likely includes
the necessary drivers (the Intel GPU driver is in the kernel and `mesa`
package, which on Arch is in base). If not already present, install
`mesa` for OpenGL/Vulkan support (gaming and graphics work). For audio,
ensure ALSA or PipeWire basics (Arch's base includes ALSA; Fedora
defaults to PipeWire which should be present even if headless). These
can also be installed later by the AI when setting up the desktop and
audio tools, so optional at this point.

**7. Install Node.js (for AI CLI tools environment):**

All your targeted AI orchestration tools (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI,
Google Gemini CLI) are distributed via **npm**. They require **Node.js
18+** to
run[\[26\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=Gemini%20CLI%20Setup%20and%20Best,Practices)[\[27\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=,cli).
Do the following:

-   Install Node.js and npm using the distro's package manager:
    -   Arch: `pacman -S nodejs npm` (Arch's repo will likely have Node
        20+ by 2025).
    -   Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install nodejs npm` (if the version is old
        (\<18), consider using NodeSource repo or nvm, but Debian
        Testing should have a recent LTS Node).
    -   Fedora: `dnf install nodejs npm` (Fedora often includes latest
        Node LTS).
    -   openSUSE: `zypper install nodejs18 npm` (openSUSE might package
        multiple versions; Node 18 is an LTS).
-   Verify with `node --version` (should be â¥ 18.x) and `npm --version`.

**8. Install AI Agent CLI Tools:**

With npm ready, install each CLI globally:

-   **OpenAI Codex CLI:** `npm install -g @openai/codex`. This installs
    the `codex`
    command[\[28\]](https://github.com/openai/codex#:~:text=%60npm%20i%20,brew%20install%20codex)[\[29\]](https://github.com/openai/codex#:~:text=Installing%20and%20running%20Codex%20CLI).
    *Note:* OpenAI's Codex CLI might prompt on first run to
    authenticate. You can use **ChatGPT credentials** (Pro/Plus account)
    or an API key to authorize access to Codex/GPT
    models[\[30\]](https://github.com/openai/codex#:~:text=Image%3A%20Codex%20CLI%20login).
    The CLI will store auth in `~/.codex` config. Make sure you have
    your OpenAI API key or ChatGPT login ready.
-   **Anthropic Claude Code:**
    `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. This provides the
    `claude` command. It requires an Anthropic API access -- ensure you
    have an API key or subscription. On first use, you'll likely need to
    provide this key or login (the tool stores credentials securely on
    first
    run)[\[31\]](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart#:~:text=%3E%20Try%20,py%20that).
    Claude Code is a paid service (unless you have access via a platform
    like AWS Bedrock), so configure billing or API key as
    needed[\[32\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=1)[\[33\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=platforms%2C%20the%20best%20experience%20is,still%20on%20Mac).
    (If you have the Claude Code subscription, you can now use it in the
    terminal.)
-   **Google Gemini CLI:** `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`. This
    sets up the `gemini` command. After install, run `gemini auth login`
    to open a browser-based Google OAuth -- login with your Google
    account to get access to Gemini's free preview (which currently
    offers generous usage with a personal
    account)[\[34\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=,cli)[\[35\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=Image).
    Once logged in, you can also set an API key (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) for
    higher-rate access if you have
    one[\[36\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20a%20personal,limits%2C%20configure%20your%20API%20key).
-   Confirm installations: run `codex --version`, `claude --help`,
    `gemini --version` to ensure they execute.

Each of these CLIs may have slightly different system integration: -
*Codex CLI* will on first run prompt for login (open a browser link to
ChatGPT login or allow API key
entry)[\[30\]](https://github.com/openai/codex#:~:text=Image%3A%20Codex%20CLI%20login). -
*Claude Code* on first run might prompt for an API key or a config file
setup (Anthropic's docs indicate credentials are stored on first
use[\[37\]](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart#:~:text=)). -
*Gemini CLI* was logged in above (it will store an auth token, often
under `~/.config/gcloud` or its own config path).

**9. Final System Tweaks before Hand-off:**

-   **Shell configuration** (optional): Since the AI will soon take
    over, you can leave further dotfile setup (like `.bashrc`
    customizations or zsh/fish config) to it. However, ensure that the
    shell environment is non-interactive friendly: e.g., disable any
    apt/pacman interactive confirmations if you want the AI to run
    updates (you can use flags like `-y` for apt/dnf, or edit
    pacman.conf to disable confirmation if needed).
-   **Security**: Consider adding your user to `/etc/sudoers` with
    NOPASSWD temporarily, if you plan to let the AI perform
    root-privileged tasks via `sudo` non-interactively. For example, in
    a root shell do
    `echo "youruser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/99-ai`.
    *This avoids the AI getting stuck at password prompts.* You can
    remove this later or tighten it once setup is done.
-   **AI tool configuration**: Prepare any API keys not already entered:
    -   For OpenAI via API key: `export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."` in your
        shell or `~/.bash_profile`. Codex CLI can use ChatGPT login, but
        an API key can be a fallback for non-interactive
        use[\[30\]](https://github.com/openai/codex#:~:text=Image%3A%20Codex%20CLI%20login).
    -   For Anthropic Claude: set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` if applicable (or the
        Claude CLI might prompt for it interactively on first use).
    -   For Gemini: we set this up in Step 8 (logged in via
        `gemini auth login` or set `GEMINI_API_KEY`).
-   Having these environment variables ready means the AI agents can
    function without manual intervention.

**10. Handover to AI Orchestration:**

At this stage, you have a minimal, networked OS with the AI agent CLI
tools installed and authenticated. Now **delegate system configuration
to your AI co-pilots**:

-   Launch an AI agent in the terminal. For example, start the OpenAI
    Codex CLI by running `codex` (or `claude` for Claude Code, `gemini`
    for Gemini CLI). You'll enter an interactive natural-language shell
    for that AI.
-   Begin issuing high-level instructions to configure your system.
    Because these tools treat natural language as inputs, you can say
    things like:
    -   *"Set up a Rust development environment with rustup and the
        necessary build tools."*
    -   *"Install a minimal Wayland desktop with Sway and configure it
        for two monitors (internal 4K laptop display and external
        1440p), using a Qt-based panel."*
    -   *"Configure audio for the system (PipeWire with low-latency
        settings) and install any needed audio tools."*
    -   *"Install AWS and GCP CLI tools and SDKs for cloud
        development."*
-   The AI agent will interpret these and execute shell commands (with
    confirmation prompts as configured). For example, Codex CLI and
    Claude Code are *agentic coding tools* that can read your
    filesystem, propose code or command changes, and apply them with
    your
    approval[\[38\]](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart#:~:text=,function%20to%20the%20main%20file)[\[39\]](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart#:~:text=Step%205%3A%20Use%20Git%20with,Claude%20Code).
    They will prompt before executing potentially destructive actions.
    You can generally approve their plans in the CLI.
-   **Networking & package parsing:** The package managers we chose are
    friendly to automation, so the AI will see predictable outputs.
    (E.g., `pacman -Qi packagename` gives a clear list of fields,
    `apt search xyz` gives a stable format -- easy for an LLM to parse).
    The AI can use these to verify installations or search for packages.
-   **Monitoring AI actions:** As the AI runs commands, watch the output
    for any issues (failed installs, etc.). Thanks to the robust base
    and large RAM, you shouldn't hit resource issues. If something goes
    wrong (say the agent syntax errors a command), you can intervene or
    correct it in conversation.
-   Gradually, have the AI configure all aspects: programming languages
    (Python, Node, Rust, Java, Lisp as needed), IDEs or editors (it can
    install VSCode or Emacs if you want, though a DE-less scenario might
    favor terminal-based tools or remote coding), GPU drivers or gaming
    tools (it can install Steam and proprietary drivers if you add a
    dGPU later), audio software (like JACK, DAWs if needed for audio
    work), etc.

By the end of this process, you'll have a fully set-up system tailored
to your needs, largely configured by AI. The **base system is minimal
and rolling**, ensuring you always have up-to-date software for
development and AI tools. From here on, you can continue to use natural
language via Claude Code or Gemini CLI to handle updates, install new
software, refactor config files, and even perform "deep research" tasks
-- essentially making **natural language the new shell for your
ThinkPad**[\[40\]](https://milvus.io/blog/claude-code-vs-gemini-cli-which-ones-the-real-dev-co-pilot.md#:~:text=Terminal%20AI%20tools%20have%20changed,tool%20handles%20the%20entire%20process).
Enjoy your automated setup!
