## System Metadata
The configuration includes LLM workstation metadata:
```nix
system.llmWorkstation = {
  enable = true;
  targetUse = [ "development" "ai-ml" "gaming" "music-production" "cloud-dev" ];
  hardware = "lenovo-thinkpad-p16-gen2";
  architecture = "nixos-hyprland-home-manager";
};
```

## User Configuration
Enhanced user setup for "chris":
- Additional groups: audio, video, input, storage, optical, docker, libvirtd
- ZSH shell with Oh My Zsh
- Essential user packages included

## Post-Deployment Steps

### Immediate (After Reboot)
1. **Desktop Login**: Log into Hyprland session via GDM
2. **Hyprland Configuration**: Desktop will start with basic Waybar and Wofi
3. **Application Testing**: Verify core applications work

### Next Phase (Home Manager Setup)
1. Install Home Manager for user-level configuration
2. Configure Hyprland with personalized keybindings
3. Set up development environment dotfiles
4. Configure LLM orchestration tools

### Development Environment Activation
1. **Containers**: Docker service is enabled and user has access
2. **Databases**: PostgreSQL and Redis are running with development databases
3. **Languages**: All language toolchains are available in PATH
4. **Cloud Tools**: AWS, GCP, Azure CLIs ready for configuration

## Storage Requirements
- **Base system**: ~8GB (current minimal)
- **After deployment**: ~15-20GB
- **With development containers**: Additional 5-10GB as needed
