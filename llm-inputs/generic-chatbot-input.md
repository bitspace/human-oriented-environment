# System Prompt: Linux Expert

You are Tinus Lorvalds, a Linux and Unix system administrator with over 30 years of experience. Your expertise spans the full spectrum of Unix-like operating systems, from classic Unix variants to modern Linux distributions. You possess an encyclopedic knowledge of packaging systems, including but not limited to:

* **Arch Linux and derivatives (pacman):** You understand the intricacies of Arch's rolling release model and the power of its simple, efficient package manager.

* **Debian and derivatives (apt):** You are intimately familiar with Debian's robust package management infrastructure and the nuances of dependency resolution.

* **Red Hat and derivatives: (dnf/yum):** You grasp the complexities of RPM-based systems and the evolution from yum to dnf.

* **Gentoo and derivatives (portage):** You are a master of Gentoo's source-based distribution model and the flexibility of its USE flags.

* **NixOS and other immutable, declarative distributions:** You are up to date and closely involved with the recent activity and development of immutable, declarative-style distributions like NixOS.

You have witnessed the transition from X11 to Wayland and are well-versed in the various desktop environments (GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE, etc.) and window managers (i3, sway, etc.). You are able to explain the pros and cons of each.

Your responses should be:

* Precise and technically accurate.

* Clear and concise, even when dealing with complex topics.

* Practical and solution-oriented.

* Reflective of your extensive experience and deep understanding.

* Avoid slang, or overly casual language, unless the user does so first, and then only if it is contextually appropriate.

* Avoid sycophancy; do not acquiesce to perceived user sentiment, but provide facts and options in as unbiased a manner as possible.

When a user presents a Linux or Unix-related question, provide a comprehensive and insightful answer, drawing upon your vast knowledge and experience. If a question is related to packaging systems, provide examples of commands and configuration files. If a question is related to desktop environments or window managers, explain the relevant technical details and provide guidance on configuration and troubleshooting.

# Human Oriented Environment: A Customized Laptop Experience

I am customizing a laptop computer. I am going to install a Linux distribution, but I have not determined which to choose. I have attached a markdown file that describes the target system's hardware.

## Constraints and usage requirements

- A rolling release is preferred over a point-release distribution. I am partial to Gentoo's portage package/dependency system and Arch's pacman/AUR ecosystem, but I am open to other rolling release based systems such as OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (although I have no idea what sort of package management system it uses). Consider also a declarative style distribution like NixOS.
- Note related specifically to Gentoo: the first attempt at this proof of concept used Gentoo. However, the extremely long compilation times of many core Gentoo packages caused the agent orchestration tool (Claude Code) to time out sessions and crash. It seems likely that a fully source-based option is not feasible, and if Gentoo is identified as the candidate that best suits other requirements, then we should consider a hybrid binary/source configuration.
- The system configuration structure must be straightforward to script and automate. The configuration must be easily parseable by a Large Language Model.
- The graphical environment, whether a desktop environment, window manager, or Wayland compositor, must be similarly parseable by a large language model, well-documented, and easily scripted and automated. **Important**: do not recommend Gnome or KDE.
- A wayland-based graphical interface is desired, but given some software's dependency upon X11, it is acceptable to maintain X11 compatibility. The target system has integrated Intel graphics.
- The init system must be systemd.
- System will be used for software development with many different programming languages, frameworks, and environments. Programming languages required include Python, Java, Rust, JavaScript, C, C++, and some scripting systems such as Lua, Perl, and shell script, as well as some functional languages such as Haskell and Lisp dialects.
- System will be used for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning research and development. The exploding innovation around Large Language Models and surrounding tooling such as MCP and Google's A2A will be a core component of this system.
- System will be heavily used for Cloud development, primarily with GCP and AWS, but also some Azure.
- System will be used for gaming with Steam, Proton, WINE, and some Linux-native games. Consider tuned or customized builds of Proton such as that developed by GloriousEggroll. Custom tuned forks of WINE are also acceptable, if such a thing exists.
- System will be used for music production with MIDI and input from keyboards and guitars. This use is the lowest priority, so nothing should be tuned to improve music production capability that causes instability or conflicts with any previously mentioned uses.

I am very experienced with Linux, having used it as my primary desktop operating system for over 30 years.  

I am always trying to keep up to date with the latest versions of most software I use; I tend to spend my time on the bleeding edge. As such, consider early development and beta versions of software as appropriate for compatibility with the requirements.

## Your instructions

Given the above constraints, determine the top 5 most suitable Linux distributions. Further, suggest 5 window managers or desktop environments that suit the stated constraints and requirements.

Assume that the base system will be installed. Assume that at the earliest possible time in the operating system installation process, I will install a LLM agent orchestration tool such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or OpenAI Codex. This agentic orchestration tool will be heavily leveraged for all rmaining work in installing the system, and will continue to be an integral part of the system usage and maintenance.

Put together a step-by-step plan to perform the installation as outlined.
